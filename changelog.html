      <div id="changelog"></div>
      <h3>2015-12-11</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Resolved a bug where some tests were not using VP9 media as expected and were instead using H264 media. Tests now use VP9 media as expected.</li>
        <li>Updated DurationAfterAppendAudio and DurationAfterAppendVideo tests on 2015, 2016, and tip. Tests are now more MSE spec compliant and account for timing issues.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2015-10-27</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Update to MediaSource duration test to make it more compatible with webkit based browsers.</li>
        <li>Branched 2016 tests.</li>
        <li>Updated test runner to have more control over the configurations for each test version. Tip will now default to VP9.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2015-10-09</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>VideoBufferSize and DASHLatency tests now handle QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERROR_CODE in 2015 and tip.</li>
        <li>Updated MediaSourceDuration on 2015 and tip to be more MSE specification compliant.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2015-10-06</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fix for webm parser that caused large segment sizes. Improved logging in webm parser.</li>
        <li>Progressive tests now support VP9.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2015-09-10</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Encrypted media tests now support VP9 on 2015.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2015-08-20</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed PlayReadySupport test on 2015 to check for 'probably' when including the codec type and 'maybe' when excluding the codec type.</li>
        <li>Improvements to 2015 EME tests. Keys and kids are now directly associated with the specific stream definition. Cleaned up EME test code.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2015-08-03</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fix to MediaSourceDuration test in 2015 and tip to assert that values are within 0.01 of the expected values.</li>
        <li>Improvements to StreamDef to allow tests that to use the format they require. This allows FrameGap and FrameOverlap to be executed in VP9 mode but with still using the H264 assets that it depends on.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2015-07-28</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a bug that caused a race condition on MediaElementTest on 2015 and tip.</li>
        <li>Clarified test result requirements for PlayReady and WideVine Support tests. It is now documented in 2015 that you must pass one of these tests.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2015-07-09</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated WidevineSupport EME test on 2015 and tip to more accurately validate the Widevine support. Now VP9 Widevine support is not tested unless WebM/VP9 is enabled.</li>
        <li>Updated AbortVideo and AbortAudio MSE tests on 2015 and tip to be event driven. This should resolve some timing issues with this test.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2015-06-16</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated DelayedAudio and DelayedVideo test cases to account for Chrome allowing 3 seconds of underflow when video starved.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2015-06-11</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Replaced WebM/VP9 Video1MB video with a video encoded with VP9 instead of VP8.</li>
        <li>Removed WebM vorbis audio files. Replaced the files with aac mp4 files.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2015-06-03</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated test-video-1MB.mp4 (Video1MB) to have a start time that starts at 0.0.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2015-05-15</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated EME tests on 2015 to use explicitly EME 0.1b.</li>
        <li>Removed key system redefining in encryptedMediaPortability.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2015-05-12</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated tests label to contain versions of the MSE and EME specs that are being targeted by the tests.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2015-03-31</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Branched EME tests from MSE conformance test suite into its own test suite for 2015 and tip.</li>
        <li>Added more control for the display and linking between test suites (performance, endurance, etc).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2015-03-26</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Update to performance tests on 2015 and tip to the latest MSE.</li>
        <li>Update to endurance tests on 2015 and tip to the latest MSE.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2015-02-13</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed bad conditional check for dual implementations of MSE webkit prefixes on tip and 2015.</li>
        <li>Removed optional parameter from EME tests that have been moved into mandatory on tip.</li>

      </ul>
      <h3>2014-12-10</h3>
      <ul>
